I really liked how *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* used the medium of the graphic novel to explain mathematical concepts in an approachable way. From pages 226 to 228, Lovelace has a cute sequence where she tries to balance on the imaginary number line and the number line pivots to its vertical position where it is commonly drawn. I liked this sequence because it used the action sequence because it melded together the concept of human imagination and mathematical imaginary numbers in a way that seemed fun and interesting. I do like how these pieces explaining mathematics were placed after the more fanciful adventure, it makes the segments more enjoyable because we are already invested in the character of Lovelace.
