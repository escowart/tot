In our world of computers, it is so easy to forget about the formatting of text to convey information. Word processors automate that part of the writing process. But the meaning hidden within the structure of text, images, and space is highlighted by earlier mediums. "As the scroll shows, the pagina need not be accompanied by an attendant material division. Nevertheless, each pagina in the roll possesses its own physicality – one that places it in close proximity to other paginae, requires a slow unfurling of the scroll, and encourages a practice of continuous reading" (pg. 5) The medium of the text is also impactful in terms of how information is read and interpreted. "These two facing pages are not part of the same folio and may not necessarily have been part of the same sheet or the same quire; nevertheless, they have an important contiguous relationship. Adjacent and conjoined, they are perceived together by the reader, even if only read one at a time. With each turn of the page, a new pair of facing pages is unveiled at the same time that the previous couple is obscured from view" (pg. 7) As this quote explains, each set of two pages within a codex are intended to be read as a pair. The pages don't exist in isolation and neither the writer or the reader should treat them as such. This concept would also apply to the scroll where the pages would flow from the one above into the one below which would imply to me that the codex has a sense of discreteness while read, while a scroll or an e-reader has a sense of continuousness. This might explain why readers might not get the same sense of accomplishment while progressing through a continuous medium. The end feels like a remote concept when you don't have a concrete way of measuring process.
