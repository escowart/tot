*Architectures of the Page* focuses on the uniqueness of each page of a codex and how that page tells a unique story about the world in which the page was composed. The text continues along this path exploring how humanity arrived at the codex from other mediums. The article describes how papyrus, clay and wooden tablets, and animal skins were used to transmit information. How each of these forms had their own version of a page and how that became the codex. The text goes in-depth to explain how some as basic as a page began to gain elements such as headers, margins, and tables.
