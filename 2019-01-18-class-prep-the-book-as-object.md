Up until the modern era, the cost of leaving blank space was quite high. In fact, there appears to be a trend that the earlier the textual piece, the more costly the piece was to make for that civilization. An example of the preservation of space on a written work can be seen on Egyptian writing where "Egyptian scribes took advantage of inkâ€™s variety and incorporated rubrication into their work, using red ink to highlight important words and ideas, as well as to indicate the start of new paragraphs." In this way they did not need to waste any space on their pages by visually representing the new paragraph. There is a strong relationship between the material and the medium which is demonstrated by this passage. The medium is constrained by the material but those constraints give the text is own unique character.
