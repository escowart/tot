While looking at 19th century newspapers, I found it very interesting how it was an all in one wrap up of everything going on in the local area. In one newspaper their was a schedule of ships each with its own icon and block of text. The block of text had a headline indicating the destination of the ship along with a short description and the date of departure. In the other newspaper the were seasonal shipping routes which we had an icon of several ships in a line and a block of text indicating the day of the week those ships departed. These bulletins helped both to market for the shipping companies and to give passage notice about when ships were going to depart. It is quite similar to how trains, subways, and planes operate today. In that, the transport companies post a schedule for public consumption such that customers can plan out their journeys well in advance. Unlike missing a train or plane which at most sets you back a day or two, missing a ship was not as forgiving.

I was struck by how significantly the medium has changed in the last 200 years. In the modern context, newspapers are generally viewed as trustworthy and well vetted sources due to their history of journalistic integrity. 19th century newspapers read like tabloids, seeing as there was no separation between editorialization and reporting. In many ways the newspapers was once a medium akin to cable and internet news outlets, in that they were outlets for pushing a partisan and ideological agenda. There appears to be a connection between a mediums age and its integrity.  This  only follows from the effort required to turn the wheels of bureaucracy, especially when politicians are directly benefitting from a lack of regulation, in this case: *free* marketing to members of their respective parties.
