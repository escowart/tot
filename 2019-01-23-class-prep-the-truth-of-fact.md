  *The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling* is a piece about both how reliance on technologies takes something away, but also gives us keen advantages. Computer natives like myself often cannot spell because the software we write with corrects or errors in real time. There is no need to learn how to spell a word if the software will fix you errors. Interestingly enough the article focuses on how this process has been going on since the invention of writing. The article explores how the artificial process of writing begins to effect how we think and understand the world around us. We sacrifice the subjective view for a more objective view of the world which can be and feel hollow and unforgiving. We start to see words and ideas as having continuity even when the interpretation of said ideas morphs as the culture and society evolves. 
  
 There are two main threads to the article, one being the author telling a cautionary tale about Remem where the author eventually begins to second guess his own assumptions after trying the product and finding it useful to address his own personal flaws. This thread is about how there is always a sense a looming danger with the advent of any breakthrough technology. There will always be a fear of fundamentally altering the human condition, but which previous generations have already dealt with. The fear of the technology has always lost to the market forces in the past, so why should we expect this time to be any different. Instead of fighting the market forces, the article is advocating a more moderate approach, be wary of how you use the new technology and how the technology uses you.
 
 The second thread focuses on a teaching writing to a youthful member of an illiterate tribe. What makes this thread interesting is that it address many of the inherit biases that become ingrained as humans learn to write. These biases can be detrimental to our thinking, however they are a necessary by-product of development into the modern condition.
