The typeface of a text can greatly influence how readers interpret a text. It can give the impression that the author is lazy or uninterested in the piece if they use a typeface like Comic Sans. If they instead use more typically "academic" fonts, they can more easily convey their ideas to the intended reader. The neatness of a typeface is composed of many factors including the style of text, the spacing between letters, and the vertical offset of letters.
