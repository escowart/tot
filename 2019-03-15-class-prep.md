Reading about a variety of bots reminded me about the Tay, which was a bot which was programmed by Microsoft to learn from twitter interactions. Twitter users could tweet at Tay and Tay would reply to them based on the tweet and what she had learn so far. Predictably, some segment of the incel community learned about Tay and decided to spam the twitter bot with memes from their far-right ideology. Within a handful of hours these trolls had turned Tay into a full blown Nazi who was openly advocating for genocide. Microsoft subsequent shut down the twitter bot and deleted her tweets. It really amazes me that Microsoft put this bot out their in good faith and didn't anticipate this happening.
