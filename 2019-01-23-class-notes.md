Would I want to use Remem if it was real?

There are obviously some benefits to having perfect recall. I would have to limit myself to viewing only happy moments. I don't really see any benefit from reliving sad or depressing moments, focusing in on negative experiences is already a problem for me (and many others). Moderation is the key, but I'm not sure that I would be able to moderate my use. I could easily see it being abused, so I would have to cre  ate some mental safeguards.
