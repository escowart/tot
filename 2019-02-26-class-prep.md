The moral & religious outrage towards novels in the 18th & 19th centuries is eerily similar to the reaction towards movies, television, comic books, or more recently the Internet & videogames. In both cases, cultural critics lament how *youths* cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality, which is a bit ridiculous. The vast majority of consumers of these products can distinguish between fiction and reality. It is true that the consumption of media impacts the thinking and behaviors of the consumer but that's not really what they are claiming. There are of course exceptional cases where *youths* decide to emulate fiction with disastrous results, however I don't understand how this wouldn't happen if they read history or religion. A great deal of history and religious text is full of generals, dictators, and gods who indulged in exorbitant amounts of violence. If you banned fiction, my guess is that the *youths* would start emulating some of the historically or religiously accurate behavior.

Although I have made my position abundantly clear, I would like to discuss *Werther* and its impact on the *youths* of the West. I find similar parallels between *Werther* & the recent discussion surrounding *13 Reasons Why*, in that there appears to be a specific condemnation of the glorification of suicide in particular. I do find it interesting that there is such a heavy focus on the glorification of self-harm, but the glorification of harm to others, usually through redemptive violence, is a popular trope in a great deal of media. It could be that because it takes little effort to self-harm it is a more common form of copycatting. However it could also be claimed that the glorification of redemptive violence acts as a marketing tool for guns and catalyst for gun violence.
