*The End of Books* explores how the book might end. The guess are fairly ridicules, however in many ways the ridiculous story about how the phonograph would replace the printed word. One author had the idea of a traveling phonograph seller who would "renting to all the inmates of the same apartment-house a sort of portable organ, which may be slung over the shoulder, composed of an infinite number of small tubes connected with his auditory shop," (See the image with all the wires hanging from windows) This description and subsequent image are quite similar to how cable companies operate in the modern world. These companies run wires to the street or apartment of potential customers and then offer residents the opportunity to subscribe to their service for a fee and offer a library of content. In many ways this fiction is foretelling of how the the television would one day replace the written word as the popular medium of entertainment. 

At 4:30 of *Farwell - ETAOIN SHRDLU - 1978*, a makeup man talked about the decommissioning of the linotype machines at the New York Times.  "It was the automation of its day, the only thing is that it was the machine that made mass education possible; It brought the price of books within the range of the average working person". The machines which made this possible were decommissioned in favor of further automation. In the form of computers. At 28:00 the narrator says "but despite automation, computerization and the continuing advances of electronics, the central factor is still the work of the human brain, the work of human eyes, and the work of human hands". This is to say that automation while it climates jobs, it does however create new ones, not necessarily as many by the nature of making of making systems more efficient. However this is the price of progress.
