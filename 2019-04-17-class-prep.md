Stories like the Walking Dead have made me accustomed to the notion that humanity will lose all moral fiber if civilization were ever to collapse. In the case *Station Eleven*, the narrative takes a much different route. Instead of the climax of the narrative being the traditional tragedy where characters are lost and the villain must be overcome, a child-soldier turns on his master out common decency. ***The boy was in motion and she wasn’t dead, the shot hadn’t come from the prophet’s rifle. (p. 303)***  The fate of the boy is certainly not pretty, but the Symphony definitely in the end old lost a single member. Which is really strange for a book taking place in a world so full of tragedy.

The sense of decency continues with Kirsten who does a burial ritual for a lunatic who ordered her execution. ***Kirsten brushed her hand over the prophet’s face to close his eyes, and placed the folded page from Station Eleven in his hand. (p. 304)*** She humanize her dead enemy which is quite a departure from what is oh so common with violence. Afterwards Kirsten adopts the dog of her enemy. ***“Luli,” Kirsten said. “Luli.” She threw a strip of dried venison, and the dog snapped it out of the air. He came close and let her stroke his head. She ran her fingers through the thick fur at the base of his neck. When they set out again, the dog stayed close by her side. (p. 305)*** She could have easily been violent towards the dog for the actions of its master, but instead she choose the adopt the dog. I find the dichotomy between the setting and narrative to be strange but also fairly refreshing. The message of the novel appears to be that our modern value system is strong enough to live on hypothetical fall of our civilization. There will still be people who choose to make art and to automate to make other's lives better, there will still be those who value decency, which is uplifting and weird message for a post-apocalyptic narrative.
