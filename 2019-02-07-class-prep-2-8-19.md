Language, culture and their mediums exist in an interlocking dance, they evolve in tandem. This process can be viewed at any point in the development of the English language. When Robert Cawdrey was developed the first English dictionary he had the goal of preventing the bastardization of the language, instead he provided the foundations for future iterations of the language. He and many others view his creation and its "children" as a rigid standard. Dictionaries are standards in the same way as technical standards, which should be strictly adhered to, they effectively operate as guild post for English language trailblazers.

A dictionary can alternatively be viewed as a catalyst of automation. In order for a piece of text to be consumed by the public, the text must be parsable by both the author and the audience. The dictionary acts as the socially contracted mode of communication for the mass produced written word; enabling the printing press to fundamentally change the human experience.
