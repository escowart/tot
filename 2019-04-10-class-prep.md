While reading *Station Eleven*, I find many parallels in the story between the life & death of Arthur, a movie star, and the life & death of modern civilization. As a movie star he represents the pinnacle of cultural significances within our civilization.  His death proceeds the death of the culture & civilization that gave his life social significance. Without civilization, his celebrity becomes meaningless while other forms of art persist and continue to bring meaning to people. I might be reading into this a bit much, but the point I see the author making is that art and popular media have entirely different functions in our lives. One is fleeting and disappears when the world changes while the other persists because of the devotion of the artist and the art-lover.
