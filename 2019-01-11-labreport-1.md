 When viewing a standard like *Markdown*, it would be helpful to examine the context which gave to the format. The vast majority of the website interfaces are built using a combination of *HTML*, *CSS*, & *Javascript* where *HTML*, a markup language, is the skeleton of a web client, holding all the piece together, *Javascript* is the brain, doing all of the calculations, and *CSS* is the skin, making everything look nice and pretty. Another key component of a website is the exchange of information between each client and the server. The two most popular languages to format data for transit are *JSON* and *XML*, a markup language. From this view, Markup can be seen as a byproduct of the emergence of the internet.

Upon the transition from the hand written text to the typewriter, there was a loss of artistic freedom in the form of textual stylization. Typewriters are generally have uniform stylization, there was no easy way to visually emphasize words. With the transition from typewriters to computer we began to regain this stylization with an added cost. In order to stylize text, in need to be encoded into a specific format. In the case of *HTML*, you have to wrap text in tags: **\<Tag>The Text is here<\/Tag>** which adds additional time.

Easy stylization of text can be quite useful to convey information which unformatted text might not encapsulate. For instance when I write tickets or make posts I find it helpful to indicate which part of the message are actually referencing code instead of being interpreted as plain English. However with a language like *HTML* or word application it consumes precision internet time to stylize your messages. Markdown makes this process much faster which is very important especially on the internet.
