A Dream Within A Dream by Edgar Allan Poe (First 3 lines)
	Take this kiss upon the brow!
	And, in parting from you now,
	Thus much let me avow--

At it's most fundamental level, programming is about feeding a machine a series of mathematical instructions which is in no way similar to literacy and art. However at the level of programmer, software development is a creative process where the programmer weaves exist concepts, structures, and libraries into an original design. There is no fixed way to program, each programmer has their own personal poetic license to solve a problem. In many ways, the qualification of code is very similar to the qualification of the written word. *The Beauty of Code* claims that quality or beautiful code can be defined as follows: "So, beautiful code is lucid, it is easy to read and understand; its organization, its shape, its architecture reveals intent as much as its declarative syntax does."  The quality of a segment of code or a piece of literature isn’t about its conciseness, but it is instead the quality of written code or text comes from how effectively the information is interpreted by its audience; it's about providing queues to the reader such that they can understand all of the concept which the author wishes to convey. The beauty of a codebase is about the proper segmentation of modules, each with its own clear intent and scope as well as the seem less integration of those same module. The quality of a written piece in a similar fashion comes from the segmentation of the text into paragraphs and the flow of each paragraph into the next. The process of producing code and literature have a multitude of parallels which explain why in some ways programming is an art form.

The relationship between literature and programming goes further than the similarities between how they are structured and qualified. The computer both assist humans in the production of their literature but can also be programmed to autonomously create their own pieces, utilizing great swaths of information available to them. The Pentametron twitter bot offers a great example about how the mixture of big data, automation, and literary concepts can be blended into an interesting and unique piece of art. Pentametron process “10% of the Twitter steam” and uses that information to construct iambic pentameters through the act of retweeting. As you can see from this example, new media offers a plethora of data which can processed and transmuted into new forms of literary art. This is an example of excellent way to adapt old media into a new medium, which is quite important if literature wishes to maintain its place in the modern cultural. The dominance of television and the internet over the media landscape, especially with the younger generations, means that the older mediums have an ever shrinking share of the market. This is why it is so important that literature embraces new media and should attempt to utilize these platforms to market itself to computer natives, particularly the young who might find the old medium dull. Without this adaptation, appreciation for literature may eventually be limited to academia alone.
