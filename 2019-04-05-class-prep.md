I find Carrison's ideas about the evolution of the book as other mediums begin to displace it. I find his reaction to the *death* of the codex refreshing. He states, "I firmly believe that every book that will eventually disappear. And I see here no reason for lamentation. Like any other living organism, books will grow, multiply, change color, and, eventually, die." It also makes sense that as books become more and more scares, the quality and creativity will increase by necessity. Like anything else the book suffers from oversaturation and could do with come evolution. His concept of a book as a space rather than a bag of text lends itself to unique and refreshing uses of the medium. This idea is expanded upon with concept of *Intermedia* that a book can be a mesh of different media: text, images, & animation. That the idea of the book can be adapted and expanded upon through the medium, whether that be images that pop out of the page or a e-book with animation or choose your own adventure elements. A great example of *Intermedia* is the 17776 football which effective utilizes the medium of the webpage while still telling a narrative & having a back and forth between characters which is indicative of a book.
