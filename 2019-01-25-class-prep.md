***ÆLFRIC’S PREFACE TO GENESIS: A TRANSLATION*** takes about the problems with translating the Catholic Bible from Latin to Old English. One of the interesting points he brings up is how to translate sections of the bible where God's name & verbs are plural; specifically any lines involving *Elohim*, a name for God meaning "Gods". I hadn't realize that Catholics consider the plural form of God to refer to the *Holy Trinity*. It was an interesting perspective on what is lost in translation.


I'm not sure what ***Chaucer’s Words to His Scrivener*** is about.

***In Praise of Scribes*** is a critique of the emergence of the printing press because it takes jobs away from hard working Scribes who would otherwise be content in their humble lives. i.e. protectionism.
