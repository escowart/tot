***ÆLFRIC’S PREFACE TO GENESIS: A TRANSLATION*** takes about the problems with translating the Catholic Bible from Latin to Old English. One of the interesting points he brings up is how to translate sections of the bible where God's name & verbs are plural; specifically any lines involving *Elohim*, a name for God meaning "Gods". I hadn't realize that Catholics consider the plural form of God to refer to the *Holy Trinity*. It was an interesting perspective on what is lost in translation. Personally I interpret the plural name of *God* to representative of the polytheistic roots of Judaism. 


I'm not sure what ***Chaucer’s Words to His Scrivener*** is about.

***In Praise of Scribes*** is a critique of the emergence of the printing press because it takes jobs away from hard working Scribes who would otherwise be content in their humble lives. i.e. protectionism. A thread that re-emerges is that paper is transitive while parchment is permanent which is reminiscent of the arguments made again transitioning from oral to the written word. The invention and adoption of the printing press was the catalyst for the industrial revolution which created a ton of new industries, and subsequently more jobs. The social benefits far outweigh the social costs.


***Making Manuscripts*** Describes the process of making a manuscript from animal skin. I find it interesting how each iteration of writing has less and less permanence than the previous medium.
