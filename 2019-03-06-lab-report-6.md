After experience each step of the printing process, I feel that I some grasp of the physical and mental toll of historical printing. In my modern context, I has a difficult time envision the printing press as a machine with weight and substance. I’m so used to the modern printer that it seems abnormal to require such a massive machine to press ink to paper. Not only was the press itself substantial, but the typeset was deceptively heavy. Though the entirety of my life, I have only ever interacted with hand or computer writing which are both extremely flexible mediums (in the modern forms) which can be modify on the fly with little to no effect. Composing type is a tedious process that requires attentiveness and focus. When you make a mistake in the type it is very similar to making a mistake in software: the act of fixing a mistake introduces risk. Like software, you can introduce another mistake while in the process of fixing the current one, but there is the additional risk of piing the type. If you don’t want to pi the type, a composer has to push the incorrect lettering out of place while keeping the correct lettering locked in place. This process became more and more difficult as we introduced more and more type. There were also several points where we had to distribute spacing characters and brackets when we either lacked or had too much space on a line. We had issues locking the type into a frame because the furniture was non-uniform. At one point some of the lettering fell out of place and we had to reposition back in place.

This experience has helped me to contextualize the experience of composing and printing a historical text. Every line of every page of historical text had to be methodically and carefully composed, transported to the printer, and its lettering redistributed after the fact. If any error occurred at any point of this process, a good amount of time and effort would be lost. The painstaking process of producing text explains why texts were originally such a costly products which were primarily consumed for the by the state, businesses, the clergy, and upper class. With the cost of production being so high, it makes sense that page space was so highly valued and that ideas were composed in such a way which minimize the consumption of space on a page.

The costs of production also shed some light on why so many of the early texts we were shown we utilitarian in nature; There wasn’t really the room in the market for less practical pieces. This means that culture that developed around the text saw it as an object both denoting a certain amount of prestige as well as an object with a great deal of function. This explains why there was such a hostile reaction to the popularization of the novel. The novel was a significant break from the norms of the historical text because it was both broadly popular and it had no practical function.
