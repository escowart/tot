In the latter half of the 19th century, the *Victoria Press* was a revolutionary printing house which employed women. The printing community at large was rather hostile to employing women in a printing shop. The contemporaries to the *Victoria Press* argued that women were incapable of working in the print house because the work was inherently masculine and that the market could not sustain the increase in the workforce. The fact the *Victoria Press* was a sustainable business acts as a succinct counterexample to these arguments. This type of reactionary argument has popped-up whenever there is a feminist push towards full equality, particularly as it relates to the workforce. These arguments tend to come from a place of fear or anxiety about having to compete as equals with people who you view as inferior.

The last 40 years of women in the workplace has clearly demonstrated that these arguments hold no water, however that has not stopped these arguments from re-emerging. Neo-reactionary pundits, activists, *thinkers*, and audiences, who are a dime a dozen on the Internet, retread many of these same arguments when talking about women in STEM, the *Me Too* movement, and when advocating for the redistribution of the means of reproduction. They claim that there is an inherent difference between men and women that explains the gender gap in STEM fields. However they dismiss the impact culture and social stigma has on each step of the development of a student. In my experience, the young tend to emulate the world around them, so it only follows that the would be drawn towards carriers where the see people who look like them.
