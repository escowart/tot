The Symphony's slogan is interesting because of its origin. “is that quote on the lead caravan would be way more profound if we hadn’t lifted it from Star Trek.” (p. 119). In particular, the origin is from a television show, a dead medium in this context, which is a story about a utopian future where humanity no longer has to worry about survival (other than through war with other advanced lifeforms) because human technology has advanced to the point were any good can be 3-D printed and human life had been extended to its utmost limit. This is so interesting because of how it is both a piece of nostalgia for a dead medium but also a future utopia which is the diametric opposite of the world the characters inhabit.

The theme of characters dreaming about the space age re-emerge on page 141 where Kirsten reads August's not her; "A fragment for my friend— If your soul left this earth I would follow and find you Silent, my starship suspended in night". Characters have this tendency to fantasize about the space age which is something people would do pre-apocalypse. I see this as character being both nostalgic and desiring to escape their current conditions.

Again on page 149 there is a reference to the starship enterprise and on the next page August says a *prayer* for a dead child and Kirsten overhears "up in the stars". 

On a different note, I found this quote quite interesting, "We bemoaned the impersonality of the modern world, but that was a lie, it seemed to him; it had never been impersonal at all. There had always been a massive delicate infrastructure of people, all of them working unnoticed around us, and when people stop going to work, the entire operation grinds to a halt.", because we as members of the modern world don't usually think about all of the systems we take for granted. We expect these  systems to always be functioning, but in fact these systems are quite fragile.
