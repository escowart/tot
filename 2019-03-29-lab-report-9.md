To understand how Marian Evens or Jane Austen might have utilized their works as computational data, the characterization of Lovelace gives a starting point, "It can be filed, indexed, converted, replicated, searched, shared, shuffled, linked, remixed, recombined, archived, analyticated, resurrected!" (The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage 193). For specific uses of text as data, we can start with the tools provided by a word processor, which allow users to freely spell-check, mutate and stylize their text in real time.  As digital information, text can be shared with others to get their input and their help addressing issues with the text. Furthermore the text can be printed at any step of the development process and easily mass distributed either as a codex or an e-book. The value of e-book is that like software it can be patched and updated at the leisure of the author. So far I've only mentioned the more straightforward usages for text as data, let's get more creative.

I could see an computation analysis of one's text as a very useful tool for an author. An author could analyze the n-grams she used and their relation as a means of assessing her tone and intent of a specific work or to analyze her style as a whole. Alternatively an author could assess the strength of her characterizations or settings by running a computational analysis of a piece index by character or setting. She could see the types of language used by each each character and within each setting. She could even do an analysis of a character's lexicon over the course of a novel and contrast the changes in their lexicon with their character changes. She could also feed plot points into an algorithm which would access the her foreshadowing and red herrings. The beauty of all of these assessment tools is that the author would be able to make changes to her piece and then run these tests again. Many if not all of the analyses would require some level of computer learning, which is why I believe that a literary artificial intelligence capable of these assessments would be a great boon to authors. These tools would assist the author at every level, not just at the level of syntax and grammar. This literary artificial intelligence could even be given the ability to access the fingerprint of an author. Then the user could compare her finger print to that of other authors. This might even facilitate the emulation of authors finger prints. If you for instance wanted to write in the English of Shakespeare, the algorithm would be able to measure the different elements of your work and decide whether or not your work resembled that of the Bard's.
