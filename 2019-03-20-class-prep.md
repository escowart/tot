I really liked that Lovelace was nettling Babbage by using Music as her means of explaining how his early computer designs could be run on symbolic representations instead of hard coded numbers. Babbage was limited in that he only saw the static Arithmetical applications of his machine, but Lovelace recognized that a dynamic Algebraic machine could be instructed to calculate nearly anything. In a very real sense, Babbage and Lovelace represent the first two iterations of computer science as a concept. I also find it interesting that Lovelace equated algorithms to poetry. It's an interesting metaphor because good code requires that you choose your function, class, and variable names to best convey the functionality to the reader. Each programmer also has a style of writing and choice of idioms because there are a multitude of ways to solve any problem with computers.
