The evolution of the writing from the quill and ink to the printing press had dramatic impacts on the greater society but also on the culture of writing. Writing was no longer a dance between the scribe and the page, but a team effort to write, compose, and print a piece. The physical natural of type had a significant impact on the way printing culture develop. Every dot, line, and space on a page had to be composed long before ink was ever pressed to paper. There would have been a deliberate calculus involved in the how each paragraph or segment of text was space and oriented in relation to the rest of the text. As well the resource of lettering was limited, meaning that the compositors had to be rigorous in their word choice and careful not to over utilize a particular set of letters. In Benjamin Franklin's autobiography, he mentions how writing and composition are composition are often distinctly different parts of the printing by implying that is strange to compose in one's head. "He could not be said to write them, for his manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head." This idea of writing prior to composing makes sense when you consider that it takes resources to compose a piece of type and furthermore you must be careful with type. It is not a simple matter to rework the type after you have already fixed a line in-place. There is much risk involved in such corrections. I believe this is what leads to a great deal of stress on the part of the printer. 

The poem below is a satirical piece about the daily grind of the printer. Like any other form of work, there was repetition. There was an art to placing and spacing type, to constructing lines which flow together which allow the eye of the reader to easily flow down each page. There was also a need to efficiently portray the information, that you wish to convey to the reader, such that you use the minimal required space. There was also the choice of type and how you placed the images in relation to the type which greatly impacted the manner in which the type read. Then there was the writing style which depended on the audience and the writer in question. 

​	Here lies a *form*, place no *imposing stone*
​	To mark the *head*, where weary it is lain,
​	Tis *matter dead*, its mission being done,
​	To be *distributed* to dust again.
​	The body is but the *Type*, at best, of man,
​	Whose *impress* is the spirit’s deathless *page*;
​	Worn out, the *type* is thrown to *pi* again,
​	The *impression* lives through an eternal age.
